ARM assembler in Xojo

### Current version: 1.2

## Change Log
1.2:
* initial version put to GitHub

## Description
This is simple assembler writen in Xojo (BASIC dialect) made as preparation for assembler in MMBasic for Colour Maximite 2 (CMM2). Because I wrongly interpretted CPU type in CMM2 (actually Cortex M7), which does't know ARM instruction set (just Thumb-2), it will be no use on CMM2 and I need to develop new version... :angry:

## Usage:
Write source file in 'Source project' window or drop text file with assembler on it and press compile.
